    <h1>A Hero's Journey</h1>
 
    <p>This is the story of <strong>Brett Bryant</strong></p> 
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>The Military life</h3>
    <p><Strong>Brett</Strong> joined the <mark>U.S. Navy</mark> right out of high school. He served honorably for <del>4737 days</del>, <del>155 months and 20 days</del>, 12 years, 11 months and 20 days. He joined because he really had no where else to go. What seemed like a <i>forced decision</i> was really the first step in him discovering who he was. At first he thought, <i>I am only doing four years</i> but as time flew by, things got easier. He decided to reenlist. <Strong>Never</Strong> did he think this would be his career choice. <em>C'est la vie</em>. Eventually, time flew by and it reached a point where he would have to leave the only job he's <em>ever</em> known. That's okay because his next journey was one of <b>self discovery and travel</b>! </p>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
   <h3>The Bus Life!</h3>
    <p>Knowing he did not want to just jump back into some <strong>job</strong>, he and his partner decided to travel. They bought <mark>Bussy!</mark> Bussy was a <i>9 window Thomas Built Bus</i>. They converted this tiny bus into a tiny home and travelled the <i>United States</i>. They left on <b>Halloween</b> and headed south. They traversed the <i>the great land of their birth</i>. They went to the <i>Grand Canyon</i>, drove up the <I>California Coast</I>, met interesting people and ate great food! <strong> But Alas!</strong> for it was not meant to be forever. Sadly, <mark>Bussy</mark> broke down. We enter another <strong>transition point</strong> in our hero's story...</p>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <h3>Enter Aniexty and the Fart Smelling town!</h3>
    <p>After <mark>Bussy</mark> broke down, there weren't many options for our heros. He and his partner decided to move back to his hometown of <b>Sarasota, FL</b>. What they found, was that they could only afford to live in the cheaper neighborhood of <b>Bradenton</b>. A cheaper, dirtier, and <del>smelly</del> smellier place <i>(the place really did smell like a fart!)</i>. Not satisfied with their lot in life, the hero couple decided that leaving the <mark>United States</mark> was the best move. But where to go? <strong>Enter Costa Rica and the traveling pair!</strong></p>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <h3>Costa Rica = Pura Vida</h3>
    <p>The power couple did it! They saved and worked, worked and saved. They sold <strong>ALL</strong> of their possessions via a <i>garage sale</i>, bought one-way plane tickets, and set their sights on <strong>new beginnings</strong>. His only regret, selling his <mark>Zune mp3 player</mark>. They made it! Right? <mark>October 26, 2019</mark> was going to be the start of a <strong> very good year</strong>. <i>That's called forshadowing...</i> </p>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <h3>Panic @ the Pandemic!</h3>
    <p><strong>Lockdown! Beaches Closed! Status Unknown!</strong> Time passes...<del>quickly</del> slowly. Eventually, things start to open. <Mark>Life-Saving</Mark> vaccine is made available. <b>Hark!</b> A light at the end of this panic tunnel. Our heros begin anew. Things improve, people survive, and life begins again. Our <Strong>Heros</Strong> think of the future. And <strong>Brett</strong> starts with learning a new language...</p>
