What seemed like a <i>forced decision</i> was really the first step in him discovering who he was. At first he thought, <i>"I am only doing four years"</i> but as time flew by, things got easier. He decided to reenlist. <Strong>Never</Strong> did he think this would be his career choice. <em>C'est la vie</em>. Eventually, time flew by and it reached a point where he would have to leave the only job he's <em>ever</em> known. That's okay because his next journey was one of <b>self discovery and travel</b>! </p>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

A cheaper, dirtier, and <del>smelly</del> smellier place <i>(the place really did smell like a fart!)</i>. Not satisfied with their lot in life, the hero couple decided that leaving the <mark>United States</mark> was the best move. But where to go? <strong>Enter Costa Rica and the traveling pair!</strong></p>
